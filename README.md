Arduino Library to use PS1 controllers

This library is a update from : https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/PSXLibrary/
Wiring is explained here : https://gamesx.com/controldata/psxcont/psxcont.htm

Beware, PS1 controllers (without analog jog) only. 
These one need a proper 5V to work.

Tested on teensy LC
